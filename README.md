# FraunhoferDiffractionSim
This very simple program simulates and generates graphs for the Fraunhofer diffraction phenomenon. It uses C++, CMake, and ROOT.
To use simply run the program, enter the parameters: slit width/slit spacing ratio and the number of slits.
The equations used in the making of this program are retrieved from Frank J. Pedrotti, Introduction to Optics (2nd Edition),
