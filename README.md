# FraunhoferDiffractionSim
This very simple program simulates and generates graphs for the Fraunhofer diffraction phenomenon. It uses C++, CMake, and ROOT.
Some pre-built binaries are available for some operating systems within the bin directory. If none is available for your OS, you
will needC++ toolchain, CMake, and the ROOT framework from CERN. All the source code is placed within the src subdirectory.
To use, simply run the program, enter the parameters: slit width/slit spacing ratio and the number of slits.
The equations used in the making of this program are retrieved from Frank J. Pedrotti, Introduction to Optics (2nd Edition), 
Chapter 16-6.
